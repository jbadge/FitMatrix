1. need help making 0.5 steps in lose fat with max being 10%

How can i make goalWeight show pop up error AND change value? (currently isValidWeight)

2. Need to refactor long code on TDEE pages
 
convert rate and goalWeight to kg when toggled

Rate does not round up

Weight does not update in goal for new user first time

*Would height in feet and inches be cleaner?
