2. Need to refactor long code on TDEE pages
 
 use cases
 if only 1 goalWeight and other was never checked, would it load up weight for the empty 1 but old value for the selected 1?
 

3. Weight does not update in goal for new user first time

4. Need signedouttdee to allow submissions over and over


does goalinfo bodyfatpercent need to be diff than statsinfo bodyfatpercent?

why is goalRate one behind?!

does statsinfo AND goalinfo need goaldate, etc?

zindex of lose fat too high goes thru navbar

Add something to track user using creatine +4-7lbs

should body fat percent change based on the goal your setting in real time?
