need help with the date for age (change m,d ,y to span)


need user to stay signed in after signing up


need help making 0.5 steps in lose fat with max being 10%

How can i make goalweight show pop up error AND change value?
Does not do calculation currently when loading up, for goalweight
calendar not updating to the text? 

Gain: goal weight placeholder not there initially
text is off when not checked.
checkboxes janky, they need to be re-rendered

slider won't work on deployed site


TO DO: (figured out with Greg)
  **How much would you like to lose, or what is your goal weight?
  ** put a lbs or kg on right of rate box to clarify what it is
