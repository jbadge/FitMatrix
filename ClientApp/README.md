# Project Title

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

<!-- Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot. -->

**Link to project:** http://everyone-loves-seeing-live-demos.com/

<!-- ![alt tag](http://placecorgi.com/1200/650) -->

 <!--   What does it do? Write a short sentence and list the working functionalities.

    What is it? Clearly, indicate what that code is supposed to produce. Is it a web, desktop, mobile app or a library?

    What technologies are used? List all the important framework and libraries that contribute to this project. It's useful for a recruiter who is not necessarily familiar with every single framework on earth to know if this is Laravel and Vue or React and Expressjs.

    What is the ambition of the project? Are you just test-driving a technology or is it something that is or will go live somewhere?

    What is the stage of the project? Clearly, indicate where you are with it. Whether it is complete or a work in progress? If it's a work in progress indicate what is done and what is pending.

    Are there some known issues or things that are not properly done? If yes list them because I'll be much more tolerant when/if I find shortcomings that have been highlighted than if I just discover them myself. -->

## Built With

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

<!-- Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. Show off your passion and make up for lack of experience, ten fold. -->

<!-- ## API

### Request methods

The request method is the way we distinguish what kind of action our endpoint is being "asked" to perform. For example, `GET` pretty much gives itself. But we also have a few other methods that we use quite often.

| Method   | Description                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | Used to retrieve a single item or a collection of items.                 |
| `POST`   | Used when creating new items e.g. a new user, post, comment etc.         |
| `PATCH`  | Used to update one or more fields on an item e.g. update e-mail of user. |
| `PUT`    | Used to replace a whole item (all fields) with new data.                 |
| `DELETE` | Used to delete an item.                                                  |

### Examples

Now that we’ve learned about the anatomy of our endpoints and the different request methods that we should use, it’s time for some examples:

| Method   | URL                                                               | Description                                                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/posts`                                                      | Retrieve all posts.                                                                         |
| `POST`   | `/api/posts`                                                      | Create a new post.                                                                          |
| `GET`    | `/api/posts/28`                                                   | Retrieve post #28.                                                                          |
| `PATCH`  | `/api/posts/28`                                                   | Update data in post #28.                                                                    |
| `POST`   | `/api/posts/28/comments`                                          | Add comment to post #28.                                                                    |
| `GET`    | `/api/posts/28/comments?status=approved&limit=10&page=4`          | Retrieve page 4 of the comments for post #28 which are approved, with 10 comments per page. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/posts/28/comments/1987` or `/api/comments/1987`             | Delete comment #1987.                                                                       |
| `GET`    | `/api/users?active=true&sort=username&direction=asc&search=nodes` | Search for "nodes" in active users, sorted by username ascendingly.                         | -->

## Optimizations

<!-- _(optional)_

Not mandatory, but looks good that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

<!-- No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _wow I actually did it!_ moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing. -->
